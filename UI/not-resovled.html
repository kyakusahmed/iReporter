            Uncle Joe Blow was a jovial man; always in a good mood. He was employed as Comptroller at the Oil Company.  All the Company’s employees liked him because of the way he handled things in his office. Once in a while, he would give out “small, small things” from the petty cash box to other Company workers whom he considered his “good friends.” When paying out money to the Company’s consultants and other contractors he would always say, “the cash box has no right to sneeze, even though it holds all the ingredients for sneezing”
